                 "The best way to calm a person is to listen to them. Ask them how they are. Don't try to talk them out of their worries and don't play them down. Someone who is worried does not need a lesson in statistics, but an open heart!\n" \
                 "Make short sentences.\n" \
                 "Do not leave the person alone.\n" \

                 "- Does the person belong to a risk group and is afraid of dying from an infection?\n" \

                 "All these fears and worries are shared by many people. Make the person feel that it is okay that they are scared and that you will stay with them. Tell them that you are sometimes scared too, but don't start talking about your own fears. It's your turn to listen right now. Let the person talk.\n\n" \
                 "Let the person talk.\n\n" \
                 "Ask open questions, like \"What's scaring you?\" instead of \"Are you scared?\" Find out what the person wants to protect, what they fear to lose.\n\n" \

                 "If you feel comfortable with this, you can repeat from time to time in your own words what the person said and ask whether you understood it correctly. Try to focus on feelings in particular - the anger, the sadness, the despair.\n\n" \
                 "Make sure that the person can express everything that is going on inside them. Keep asking questions and encourage them to think the worries through.\n\n" \
                 "If you feel that they really told everything, ask them what would be good for them now. Also ask them what you could do to make them feel better. Sometimes there's something concrete you can do. It may feel like nothing is helping that person right now. You should embrace that feeling. Do not try to get rid of it, for example by giving good advice. Remember: It helps that you are there for them! Offer to get back to them after a certain time and ask them what they will do until then.\n\n" \
                 "If you have promised to get back in touch, make sure you keep it. If you feel unwell after the conversation, pick up the phone and talk to a friend. Because fear separates us. When we connect with others, it gets smaller.\n";
